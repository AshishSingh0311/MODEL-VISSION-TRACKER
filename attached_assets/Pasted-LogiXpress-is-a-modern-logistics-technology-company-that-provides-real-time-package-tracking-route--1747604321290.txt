LogiXpress is a modern logistics technology company that provides real-time package tracking, route optimization, warehouse coordination, and customer notification systems for courier and supply chain businesses. Headquartered in Mumbai with operations across India, Southeast Asia, and Europe, LogiXpress powers time-sensitive logistics for e-commerce platforms, pharmaceuticals, and retail chains.

To ensure uninterrupted, 24/7 service, LogiXpress hosts its core logistics applications across a multi-cloud infrastructure, using Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). These platforms redundantly support services like delivery tracking APIs, route engines, customer alerts, and logistics dashboards.

üîÑ Cloud Failover and Business Continuity
LogiXpress uses a custom-built Multi-Cloud Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Framework that automatically:

Monitors health and performance of AWS, Azure, and GCP

Detects outages or degraded service in real time

Instantly shifts the business application from the affected cloud to the next healthiest one

Logs all failover events with timestamps and recovery details

Displays real-time system status on a Streamlit dashboard

Example Scenario:

If AWS experiences an EC2 failure or network outage, the system logs the incident, reroutes all traffic to Azure, and restores the latest application state. The dashboard immediately reflects this shift, showing AWS as "DOWN" and Azure as the "ACTIVE PROVIDER."
